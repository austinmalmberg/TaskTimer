# Task Timer

## What is it?

A productivity application where the user can create a task queue.  The idea is to spend x amount of time working on that task before taking a break.

## How do I use it?

Create tasks, either manually or drag and drop .msg files (emails) into the application.  Once your queue has been created, begin a countdown (20 minutes by default) where you will work on that task until the time expires. You then have the option to continue working on the same task for another countdown period, or move it to the end of the queue.  After each countdown, you will have a break (10 minutes by default) before the next task countdown begins.
